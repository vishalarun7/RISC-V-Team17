Hi, my name is Emir. I worked on the ALU and the program counter part of the project.
I've implemented the multiplexers that are needed for the program counter of the RISC-V CPU to work properly. 

Program counters are an essential part of the CPU since it allows the data to be retrieved from its memory correctly. 
If a CPU didn't had this critical part, it wouldn't be able to save any cache from softwares.

From this group project, I learnt how to use SystemVerilog for designing CPU or similar stuff. 
I also familiarized myself with SystemVerilog's syntax which differs quitye a bit from high level programming languages.

In the future, I am considering to deep dive more into CPU's and even want experiment with RISC-V motherboards to learn it even more in depth.
